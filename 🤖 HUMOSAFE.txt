🤖 HUMOSAFE
AI-Powered Humanoid Security Guardian
“Always Alert. Always Aware.”

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
HUMOSAFE is an intelligent AI-powered humanoid security robot designed to provide 24/7 autonomous security for fixed high-risk locations such as ATMs, vault rooms, laboratories, server rooms, and restricted office zones.
Unlike traditional CCTV systems that only record incidents or human guards who are limited by fatigue and availability, HUMOSAFE actively detects, interacts, verifies, decides, and responds in real time — just like a human security guard.

2. EXISTING PROBLEMS
	•	Small facilities depend on human watchmen or CCTV 
	•	Human guards may: 
	•	Sleep
	•	Get distracted
	•	Be unavailable 
	•	CCTV systems: 
	•	Only record incidents
	•	Do not prevent crimes 
	•	Unauthorized access is often detected after damage occurs 
	•	No real-time response or interaction 

3. NEED FOR THE SOLUTION
There is a need for an intelligent, automated, and interactive security system that:
	•	Works 24/7 without fatigue 
	•	Actively prevents unauthorized access 
	•	Detects humans accurately 
	•	Verifies authorized entry 
	•	Sends instant alerts 
	•	Logs all activities securely 

4. PROPOSED SOLUTION – HUMOSAFE
HUMOSAFE replaces traditional security systems with a humanoid AI security robot that:
	•	Continuously monitors a secured area 
	•	Detects human presence using sensors and AI vision 
	•	Interacts like a real guard 
	•	Verifies access using RFID 
	•	Triggers alarms and GSM calls for intrusions 
	•	Displays real-time system status on a 2.8-inch SPI TFT Touch Display 
	•	Logs all activities in a mobile app 

5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Core Working Cycle:
Standby → Detect → Interact → Verify → Decide → Act → Log

7. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CORE
AI Vision (ESP32-CAM)
	•	AI model trained using Google Teachable Machine 
	•	Runs using TensorFlow Lite 
	•	Classifies: 
	•	Human vs non-human movement 
	•	Authorized vs unauthorized presence 
	•	Works with PIR + ultrasonic data to avoid false detection 

8. INTERACTIVE HUMANOID BEHAVIOR
HUMOSAFE is not just a sensor box — it behaves like a human guard.
Features:
	•	Turns toward detected person 
	•	Uses voice prompts: 
	•	“Please scan your RFID card” 
	•	“Access denied. Leave immediately” 
	•	Uses servo-based gestures for realism 
	•	Escalates response if warnings are ignored 

9. ACCESS VERIFICATION SYSTEM
	•	RFID-based authentication using RC522 
	•	Authorized RFID UID stored in database 
	•	Verification result: 
	•	✅ Access granted → log stored 
	•	❌ Access denied → alarm triggered 

10. ALERT & RESPONSE SYSTEM
If unauthorized access is detected:
	•	🚨 Buzzer alarm activated 
	•	📞 GSM module places automatic phone call 
	•	📩 SMS alert sent to owner 
	•	🔔 Push notification via app 
	•	📺 Alert message shown on TFT display 
	•	📷 Image captured by ESP32-CAM

	•	Ultrasonic confirms approach 
	•	ESP32-CAM detects human 
	•	Robot turns and interacts 
	•	TFT displays “Scan RFID” 
	•	RFID verified 
	•	If authorized → allow & log 
	•	If unauthorized → alarm + GSM + app alert 
	•	Event stored in cloud
