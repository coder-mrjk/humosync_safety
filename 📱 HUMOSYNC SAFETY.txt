📱 HUMOSYNC SAFETY
Intelligent Robot Monitoring & Control App

🧠 OVERVIEW
HUMOSYNC SAFETY is a real-time Flutter-based mobile application designed to act as the digital brain and command center for the HUMOSAFE humanoid security robot.  The app enables live monitoring, AI-based decision awareness, access logging, emergency control, and cloud-backed evidence storage, ensuring instant human intervention when required.
The application bridges robot hardware, AI intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and the user, transforming HUMOSAFE from a standalone robot into a connected intelligent security ecosystem.

🔐 1. User Authentication & Security 
HUMOSYNC SAFETY ensures that only verified users can access the robot and its sensitive data.
Functionality
	•	Secure email/password authentication 
	•	Firebase Authentication integration

🔒 This keeps the system secure while remaining simple and student-project friendly.

📡 2. Robot Connection & Status
The app continuously communicates with the HUMOSAFE robot to ensure live operational awareness.
Displayed Information
	•	Robot Online / Offline status 
	•	Network mode: 
	•	WiFi active 
	•	GSM fallback active 
	•	Last successful sync timestamp 
Behavior
	•	Real-time status polling via Firebase / HTTP 
	•	Auto-reconnect attempts if connection drops 
	•	Immediate alert if robot goes offline unexpectedly 
Importance
This ensures the owner never loses awareness of whether the security robot is active or unreachable.

📹 3. Live Camera Monitoring
The app provides real-time visual monitoring using the ESP32-CAM mounted on the robot.
Features
	•	Live video stream inside the Flutter app 
	•	Full-screen viewing mode 
	•	Snapshot capture 
	•	Automatic image capture during intrusions 
	•	Cloud upload of captured frames 
Use Case
	•	Remote surveillance 
	•	Visual verification of intruders 
	•	Evidence collection 
📸 This feature transforms passive CCTV into interactive live security.

🧍 4. Human Detection & AI Result Display
HUMOSYNC SAFETY displays AI-generated intelligence, not raw sensor data.
AI Outputs Shown
	•	Human detected / No human detected 
	•	Identity status: 
	•	Authorized 
	•	Unauthorized 
	•	Unknown 
	•	AI confidence level 
Workflow
	•	Robot detects human using vision & sensors 
	•	AI processes image locally or via model 
	•	Result is sent to Firebase 
	•	App updates instantly 
Benefit
The user sees decisions, not just data, making the system intuitive and actionable.

🪪 5. RFID Access Control Logs
Every RFID interaction is securely recorded and visualized inside the app.
Logged Parameters

	•	Access result (Granted / Denied) 
	•	Date & time 
	•	Location tag 
Features
	•	Scrollable access history 
	•	Search by date 
	•	Cloud-synced logs (tamper-proof) 
Impact
Creates a digital attendance & access record, useful for audits and investigations.

🚨 6. Intruder Alert System
This is the critical emergency response module of HUMOSYNC SAFETY.
Trigger Conditions
	•	Unauthorized RFID attempt 
	•	AI identifies unknown or suspicious human 
	•	Repeated access failures 
Alert Actions
	•	Instant app alert 
	•	Intrusion status screen 
	•	GSM call trigger confirmation 
	•	Alarm activation indicator 
User Interaction
	•	Acknowledge alert 
	•	Trigger manual escalation 
	•	Silence alarm (if verified safe) 
🚨 Ensures zero response delay during security breaches.

🕒 7. Event & Activity Timeline
The app maintains a complete chronological security history.
Timeline Includes
	•	Human detection events 
	•	RFID access attempts 
	•	Intruder alerts 
	•	Manual overrides 
	•	System state changes 
Features
	•	Date-wise filtering 
	•	Event-type filtering 
	•	Cloud-synced immutable logs 
	•	Exportable reports (PDF/CSV – optional) 
Use Case
	•	Incident analysis 
	•	Security audits 
	•	Performance evaluation 

🎮 8. Manual Override Controls (ADVANCED)
This module allows direct human control over the robot during emergencies.
Advanced Controls
	•	Alarm trigger / stop 
	•	Servo lock & unlock 
	•	Robot movement freeze 
	•	Gesture command execution 
	•	Emergency shutdown mode 
Safety Design
	•	Confirmation prompts 
	•	Time-limited override access 
	•	All overrides logged in cloud 
Importance
Ensures human authority always overrides AI, a key ethical and safety principle.

📍 9. Location & Time Logging
HUMOSYNC SAFETY maintains accurate spatial and temporal awareness.
Logged Data
	•	GPS coordinates from robot 
	•	Event time stamps 
	•	Location tagging for each incident 
Application
